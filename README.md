# Alien Invasion Game

## Overview

Alien Invasion is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a rocket ship at the bottom center of the screen. The goal is to shoot down fleets of aliens moving horizontally across the screen while avoiding collisions and enemy fire.

## Gameplay Features

- **Controls:** Use the arrow keys (left and right) to move the ship. Press the spacebar to shoot bullets at the aliens.
  
- **Alien Fleet:** Initially, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across the screen.
  
- **Destroy Aliens:** Shoot bullets to destroy the aliens. Each alien destroyed earns the player points.
  
- **Increasing Difficulty:** After clearing a fleet, a new fleet appears that moves faster, challenging the player's reflexes.
  
- **Ship Health:** The player starts with three ships. Colliding with an alien or allowing an alien to reach the bottom of the screen costs a ship.
  
- **Game Over:** The game ends when the player loses all three ships.

## How to Play

1. **Movement:** Use the arrow keys (left and right) to navigate the ship.
   
2. **Shooting:** Press the spacebar to fire bullets and eliminate the aliens.
   
3. **Objective:** Shoot down all aliens while preserving your ships to achieve the highest score possible.
